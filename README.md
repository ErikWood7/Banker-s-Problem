# Banker's Algorithm for Deadlock Avoidance

This project implements the Banker's Algorithm in C++ to help simulate and solve the problem of deadlock avoidance in operating systems. The algorithm ensures that resource allocation is only done if it keeps the system in a "safe state," which means no process will be stuck waiting indefinitely for resources.

## Problem Overview

We’re working with:
- **5 processes (P0 to P4)**.
- **3 resource types (A, B, C)**, where:
  - Resource A has 10 instances.
  - Resource B has 5 instances.
  - Resource C has 7 instances.

At a specific moment in time, the system is in a state where:
- We know the resources each process has been allocated.
- We know the maximum resources each process will ever need.
- We know the resources currently available in the system.

The goal is to determine:
1. If the system is in a **safe state**.
2. If it is, what is the **safe sequence** for executing all the processes without causing a deadlock.

## How This Solves the Problem

The Banker's Algorithm avoids deadlocks by checking if resource requests can be granted safely. It does this by:
1. Calculating the **need matrix** (resources still required for each process).
2. Simulating whether the available resources can safely meet the needs of all processes in some order.
3. If all processes can finish without leaving the system in a blocked state, the system is considered **safe**.

This approach ensures that resources are allocated responsibly, avoiding scenarios where processes could end up waiting for resources forever.
